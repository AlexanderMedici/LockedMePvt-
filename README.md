## Description 
<p>Company Lockers Pvt. Ltd. hired you as a Full Stack Developer. They aim to digitize their products and chose LockedMe.com as their first project to start with. You‚Äôre asked to develop a prototype of the application. The prototype of the application will be then presented to the relevant stakeholders for the budget approval. Your manager has set up a meeting where you‚Äôre asked to present the following in the next 15 working days (3 weeks):</p> 

<li>Specification document - Product‚Äôs capabilities, appearance, and user interactions</li>

<li>Number and duration of sprints required </li>

<li>Setting up Git and GitHub account to store and track your enhancements of the prototype</li> 

<li>Java concepts being used in the project</li> 

<li>Data Structures where sorting and searching techniques are used. </li>

<p>Generic features and three operations: </p>

<li>Retrieving the file names in an ascending order</li>

<p>Business-level operations:</p>

<li>Option to add a user specified file to the application</li>

<li>Option to delete a user specified file from the application</li>

<li>Option to search a user specified file from the application</li>

<li>Navigation option to close the current execution context and return to the main context</li>

<li>Option to close the application</li>

 

<li>The goal of the company is to deliver a high-end quality product as early as possible.</li> 
 

<p>The flow and features of the application:</p>

<li>Plan more than two sprints to complete the application </li>

<li>Document the flow of the application and prepare a flow chart</li> 

<li>List the core concepts and algorithms being used to complete this application</li>

<p>Code to display the welcome screen. It should display:</p>

<li>Application name and the developer details </li>

<li>The details of the user interface such as options displaying the user interaction information </li>

<li>Features to accept the user input to select one of the options listed </li>

<li>The first option should return the current file names in ascending order. The root directory can be either empty or contain few files or folders in it</li>

<p>The second option should return the details of the user interface such as options displaying the following:</p>

<li>Add a file to the existing directory list</li>

<li>You can ignore the case sensitivity of the file names </li>

<li>Delete a user specified file from the existing directory list</li>

<li>You can add the case sensitivity on the file name in order to ensure that the right file is deleted from the directory list</li>

<li>Return a message if FNF (File not found)</li>

<li>Search a user specified file from the main directory</li>

<li>You can add the case sensitivity on the file name to retrieve the correct file</li>

<li>Display the result upon successful operation</li>

<li>Display the result upon unsuccessful operation</li>

<li>Option to navigate back to the main context</li>

<li>There should be a third option to close the application</li>

<li>Implement the appropriate concepts such as exceptions, collections, and sorting techniques for source code optimization and increased performance </li>

## Use-Case 

- A Command Line Interface 
- Create Delete Search For A File
- Return Files Alphabetically
- Keep Your Directory Clean 

File management is the best use case for this type of software. File management is the process of administering a system that correctly handles digital data. Therefore, an effective file management system improves the overall function of a business workflow. It also organizes important data and provides a searchable database for quick retrieval.
